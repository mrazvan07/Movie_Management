## Movie Management

### Project description
---
The Movie Management project is a **mobile application** designed to manage a movie rentals collection. It allows users to **login, view, add, edit, and delete** movies from their collection. The application will also display information about each movie, such as its title, release year, number of rentals and a photo. It incorporates **additional features** that are not directly related to movie management, such as the **ability to take photos and save a Google Maps Location**, that are included for display purposes and to enhance the user experience. These features have been thoughtfully implemented and can be easily integrated into the application.
